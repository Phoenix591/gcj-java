This repository exists to provide a way to compile a modern version of java starting from the old GCJ.
Start by building sys-devel/gcc:5.5.0 with gcj enabled, temporarily set this as the system compiler then install ant-core  gcj-jdk to complete the first set of java tools.
Then use eselect java-vm to set these tools as the system vm.
Use this to emerge dev-java/icedtea:7, set that as the system vm
Finally we can install our first version of java 8, =dev-java/icedtea-3.0.1 (set that as the system-vm)
Now we can finally reset our latest modern gcc as your system compiler, and build a modern java 8, at the time of this writing 3.16.0
